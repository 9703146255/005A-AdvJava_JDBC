2) How to create interfaces
3) How to implement interfaces
4) Interface changes in java 1.8
5) Marker/tagged interfaces	
6) What is serialization
7) What is de-serialization

1) What is interface
==============
=>An interface is a blueprint of a class which is having absract methods only upto java 1.7v

=>by using interfaces we can achieve 100% abstraction

    what we can achieve
	===============
	->we can achive loosly coupling
	->we can achive multiple inheritence
	->we can achive abstraction

2) How to create interfaces
====================
interface interfacename
=> interface Vehicle



	sintax
	-------
	interface {

  	  // declare constant fields
	   // declare methods that abstract 
  	  // by default.   
		}

3) How to implement interfaces
=======================
note: implements:-> we have to override the existing abstract methods
=>EX1]
	interface Vehicle
	{
		{
		public void run();
		}
	}
	class Car
	{
		public void run()
		{
		System.out.println("CAR IS RUNNING");
		}
	}


=>EX2]
	interface Bike
	{
		{
		public void run();
		}
	}
	class FZ extends Bike
	{
		public void run()
		{
		System.out.println("FZ IS RUNNING");
		}
	}


=>EX3]
	interface Bank
	{
		{
		public double rateOfInterest();
		}
	}
	class SBI implements Bank
	{
		public double rateOfInterest()
		{
		 return 3.5;
		}
	}
	class Union implements Bank
	{
		public double rateOfInterest()
		{
		 return 3.5;
		}
	}


4) Interface changes in java 1.8
======================
1)Default method
2)Static method

5) Marker/tagged interfaces[Serializable, Cloneable, Remote , RandomAccess, Readable and Appendable, AutoCloseable]
=====================
Empty inteface is called marker interface or tagged interface

or 

A interface dont have methods and fields or members called marker or tagged interface.

ex: Serializable, Remote, RandomAccess, Cloneable

	Note: If empty interface is there what is the use for that
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	JVM will provode special instructions to the Marker interface
	ex:if company employee enter to the company that emplyee not opened the door, security guard see just ID  and open the door[this is the special behavior]



1]Serializable, [conv->obj to bytestream]
2]Cloneable,   [creates copy of object]
3]Remote ,      [it will access remote methods], methods of objects to be invoked from other JVMs, Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
4]RandomAccess, 
5]Readable and Appendable,
6]AutoCloseable]

6) What is serialization
================
	The process of converting Java object into byteStream over a network called serialization.
